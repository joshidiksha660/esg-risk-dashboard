# ESG Risk Dashboard – Inspired by Deloitte Strategy & Risk Advisory

## 📖 Overview  
This project explores the **intersection of climate impact and sustainability performance** through an interactive Tableau dashboard.  
By visualizing **CO₂ emissions, GDP per capita, and ESG scores** across countries, the dashboard provides actionable insights that can guide **governments, businesses, investors, and researchers** toward data-driven climate strategies.

## ❓ Problem it Solves  
Climate and ESG data are often siloed and difficult to interpret.  
This dashboard consolidates global datasets into **clear, interactive visualizations**, enabling users to:  
- Compare countries by emissions, GDP, and ESG scores.  
- Track **CO₂ emission trends over time**.  
- Spot **outliers** (high emissions + low ESG).  
- Understand the **trade-off between economic growth and environmental cost**.

## 🌍 Real-World Applications  
- **Governments** → monitor climate targets, carbon tax policies, sustainability goals.  
- **Businesses** → benchmark ESG scores, manage supply chain risks.  
- **Investors** → evaluate sustainable finance opportunities & risks.  
- **Researchers/NGOs** → study global climate patterns & advocate for change.
